The most beautiful, accurate, and addictive single-file FIFA World Cup 2026 simulator on the internet.

[Live Demo for fixture and sim](https://fixture2026.com/index.html)

[Live demo for updated played matches](https://fixture2026.com/live.html) (I will update it with the current results, but you can still make scenarios for RO32 qualifying.) 

### Features

- Simulation based on FIFA ranking positions.
- Real Poisson-distributed scores (feels like actual football)
- Head-to-head tiebreakers (FIFA-official)
- Live penalty validation + auto-clear
- Persistent saves (localStorage) — close tab, come back, your sim is still there
- "Dirty state" warnings when group results change after knockout generation
- Champion confetti celebration + Path to Glory recap with checkmark/x icons
- Cyberpunk neon aesthetic with randomized color theme on load
- 100% single HTML file — no build, no server, no nonsense

### How to Use
1. Click "SIMULATE GROUP STAGE" or fill scores manually
2. Generate Round of 32 → R16 → QF → SF → Final
3. When the final is complete → enjoy the champion celebration

### Updated for the Official Draw (Dec 5, 2025)
Groups include real play-off candidates (UEFA Path A/B/C/D + Intercontinental) — perfect for "what-if" simulations until the final spots are decided in March 2026. Will also be updated with live results as the matches progress.
